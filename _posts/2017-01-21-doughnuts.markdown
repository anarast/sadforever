<h2>Happy Holidays from the Doughnuts</h2>
<h4><p>To our dear Friends and Family - a holiday update from the Doughnuts:</p></h4>
<p>With 2015 fast approaching, we marvel at how quickly time flies! The kids are growing up now and a couple of them are even off the payroll! We are so thankful for the Lord's blessings.</p>
<p>Danielle "Doughnut" Doughnut is 25 now and has almost completed her entire bucket list. Having accomplished so many of these ambitious, bucket-related tasks, including "Wear a bucket for one year," "Eat 20 doughnuts out of a bucket in 5 minutes" (after which she acquired her nickname!) and "Become a doctor," we have no doubt that the last item on the list, "Destroy Buzzfeed," will be completed shortly.</p>
<p>We are equally proud of Stephen Doughnut, our middle child. He recently cleaned the fridge - not to mention the freezer - and is well on his way to washing his bedsheets.
Stephen turned 21 just a month ago and has informed us that he is going to save himself until marriage. Stephen enjoys eating chocolate and dyeing his hair.</p>
<p>Finally, our youngest, Jelly, is making steady progress with her therapist. She is slowly but surely learning that to change her name would be to defy the Lord.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and all three of them are really into outdoor activities and charity. Charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity
charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity charity preferably of the foreign variety</p>
<p>We lost our beloved Dog, Doughnut-Hole, this year. D-hole was a great dog. It was sad but he is with the Lord now.</p>
<p>May this Holiday Season bring you much Joy, Love, and Family Fun.</p>
<p>We are praying for you constantly,</p>
<p>The Doughnuts</p><br>
