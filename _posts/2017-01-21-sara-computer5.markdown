  <h1>Sara & The Computer: Episode 5</h1>

  <p><em>(By ST and EP)</em></p>

  <hr>

  <p><em>Sara and the Computer are having a picnic in a very picturesque park. A sparkling stream
  runs through it, with stepping stones and ducks and a weeping willow. Sara has set
  down a blanket underneath the willow and is munching an apple. She and the Computer
  are deep in discussion.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div>Yes, but if it's a simple matter of competitive stair-sliding I still don't get why they <em>have</em> to
  be dressed as tacos...</div>

  <p><em>On the other side of the stream, Guy and his Computer are also having a conversational picnic. Guy is eating
  a pear.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">GUY</div>
  <div>No, I understand perfectly what a frisbee is. That's exactly why I don't get how someone would use it as <em>that</em> particular
  item of clothing...</div>

  <p><em>Back on the other side of the stream, Sara is excited.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div>We are doing this! E-four!!</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
  <div>Sara, please recall that blindfold chess is highly discouraged due to the potentially lethal mental stress it causes the players.</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div>(rolls eyes) It's me, dude. I can handle it.</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
  <div>Last time we played you threw your plate of nachos out the window.</div>

  <p><em>Sara uses her arm to make a rude noise, muttering something about not being hungry.
  The noise is loud enough to be heard by Guy and his Computer, the former of which
  looks around and spots the other picnic.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">GUY</div>
  <div>(yelling) Hey! We are trying to have a civilized discussion here. Try to keep it down with the inane antics, OK?</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div>(to the Computer) Ugh, it's Guy. <br /> (cupping hands around mouth) Our antics are none of your business, buttboy.</div>

  <p><em>Camera zooms out fully to reveal that the stream is less than a metre wide. It becomes clear that each party
  has been aware of the others' presence since at least the beginning of the episode, though one can only
  speculate as to whether their conversation has been tailored specifically to impress and/or amuse the other.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div>Knight to F-three!</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">GUY</div>
  <div>Alors si tu dis "fesses de sucre" tu as quelle image dans ta t&ecircte?</div>

  <p><em>Sara and Guy go back to ignoring each other. Guy and his Computer begin a conversation about the linguistic differences
  between French and English and how they affect the interpretation of ideas. Sara insists on playing blindfold chess until she falls asleep.</em></p>

  <p>THE END</p>
