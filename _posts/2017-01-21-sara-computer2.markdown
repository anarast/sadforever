  <h1>Sara & The Computer: Episode 2</h1>

  <p><em>(By ST and EP)</em></p>

  <hr>

  <p><em>(Sara's House.) Sara and her Computer are playing chess.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div>Your moves are stale, mate.</div>

  <p><em>The Computer flashes a thumbs down on its screen. Sara sticks her tongue out and aggressively moves a bishop.</em></p>

  <p><em>Outside, a boy walks down the street. The Computer sees him through the window.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
  <div>Who is that?</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div>What do you mean, 'who is that'?? That's my number one rival,
  Guy Sticklum! <em>(leans out the window)</em> HEY STINKUMS! GET OFF MY
  LAWN!</div>

  <p><em>Without breaking his stride, Guy flips Sara the bird. Sara rolls her eyes around in a full circle.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div><em>(loudly)</em> Crude much, Stinkums?</div>

  <p><em>Sara quickly grabs the Computer, taps a couple times on the screen, and hurls it out
  the window directly at Guy's head. He catches it. Close-up on the screen: a
  naked butt.</em></p>

  <p>THE END</p>
