	  <h1>Sara & The Computer: Episode 3</h1>

		<p><em>(By ST and EP)</em></p>

		<hr>

		<p><em>Sara and the Computer are in a grocery store aisle. Sara squints at the shelves, shakes her head,
		and they move on. Camera zooms out to reveal that the grocery store aisle is actually a street in a
		city-sized grocery store. </em></p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>(glancing around) We could be lost?</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
		<div>We have yet to find the Sugar Butts.</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>I know! Sugar Butts is the greatest cereal ever, you would think they'd make it easier to find!</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
		<div>I can look up the directions to exit the city.</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>Nah, let's try looking a bit longer. I need those 'Butts! Hey, maybe they're in the Snack Shacks!</div>

		<p><em>Re-energized by the thought of Sugar Butts, Sara races through the streets. Before she realizes it,
		she and the Computer are in an area of the store that seems somehow darker than the rest of the city.
		The shelves around them are sparsely stocked and in disarray.</em></p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
		<div>I think we are on the wrong side of the snacks.</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>Guess I got carried away. Let's retrace our steps.</div>

		<p><em>They make their way back down the aisle. A dark mass of figures comes into view at the
		edge of the snack section. As Sara and the computer get closer, they see that the figures are
		no taller than Sara's knee. They toddle around as if inebriated, menacing looks on their faces.
		Each one has a tablet similar to Sara's computer, but they are all either completely
		smashed or covered in illegible text.</em></p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>Oh shirt!!!! It's the Baby Hacker Gang!</div>

		<p>[[COMMERCIAL BREAK]]</p>

		<p><em>At the kitchen table, a boy child sighs unhappily.</em></p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">BOY CHILD</div>
		<div>I hate breakfast!</div>

		<p><em>A child-sized bear crashes through the kitchen window.</em></p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">BEAR</div>
		<div>Did you just say you hate breakfast!?</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">BOY CHILD</div>
		<div>(unfazed by bear presence) Yeah! This crummy oatmeal is the worst!</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">BEAR</div>
		<div>(gasps) OATMEAL! No wonder you hate this most important and sacred meal of the day!
		How about we play a game instead!</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">BOY CHILD</div>
		<div>(perking up) Okay!</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">BEAR</div>
		<div>I dare you... to eat my shorts!!</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">BOY CHILD</div>
		<div>(giggles) I'll do it! (takes a bite of the bear's shorts) (boy's eyes widen) Hey!!
		Your shorts taste sweet! Very sweet... like they're made of sugar!</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">BEAR</div>
		<div>That's not all, my friend... My whole butt is made of sugar!!</div>

		<p><em>Boy Child starts to chase the bear around the kitchen, trying to grab pieces of the bear's butt.
		Voice-over: "Sugar Butts: The sweetest shit around."</em></p>

		<p>[[END COMMERCIAL BREAK]]</p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>Oh shirt!!!! It's the Baby Hacker Gang!</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
		<div>Baby Hacker Gang. A gang of baby hackers.</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>Yeah, they're one of the most dangerous gangs around!
		Nothing is safe around babies anymore. Computer, you gotta hide! Those babies will defos hack you first!</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
		<div>I have a plan. You can trust me.</div>

    <br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>OK... but this better work. I don't want some baby throwing you off a snack shelf!</div>
