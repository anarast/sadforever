	  <h1>Sara & The Computer: Episode 4</h1>

		<p><em>(By ST and EP)</em></p>

		<hr>

		<p><em>The Baby Hacker Gang approaches slowly but steadily (save for a few tumbles here and there).
		Sara carefully holds up the Computer in front of her like a shield, its screen facing the babies.</em></p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA<br>(whispering)</div>
		<div>You sure about this?</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
		<div>One-hundo-percent.</div>

		<p><em>Sara winces as the gang closes in on them.</em></p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>(under her breath) It's ride or die now, bud.</div>

		<p><em>Suddenly a noise starts to play from the Computer's speakers. The tune is gentle and melodic.
		The words are soothing, evoking themes of nighttime and restfulness. On the screen, a baby blue puppy rocks back
		and forth under a starry sky.</em></p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>(softly) A lullaby! Computer, you're a dang genius!</div>

		<p><em>The lullaby's effects on the gang are deadly and immediate. The last of the few intact tablets that were previously
		clutched in their sticky grip now drop to the ground, smashing on the concrete like so many before
		them. The gang members themselves begin to topple one by one, making little yawning noises as their
		diapers hit the floor. Sara starts to inch around the babies, and the Computer continues its hypnotic song. Finally,
		Sara and the Computer are out of the Snack Shacks, and back in Main Aisle.</em></p>

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
		<div>Should we keep looking for Sugar Butts?</div>

		<br />

		<div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
		<div>(sighs) Nah. After today I've seen enough butts for a lifetime!</div>

		<p>THE END</p>
