  <h1>Sara & The Computer: Episode 6</h1>

  <p><em>(By ST and EP)</em></p>

  <hr>

  <p><em>Sara and the computer are playing virtual catch in the front yard. It is sunny, but the air is cool and crisp; autumn is just beginning.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div><em>(throwing the virtual ball)</em> Yo, Computer. Let's have a fancy dinner tonight. I'll make nachos.</div>

  <p><em>A catcher's mitt appears on the Computer's screen. An animation plays: a baseball hitting the mitt right in the centre. A perfect catch.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div>Nice one!</div>

  <p><em>On the other side of the street, Guy Sticklum spins a frisbee in one hand.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
  <div>Look, it's Guy. Maybe he wants to play with us.</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div><em>(Catches the ball behind her back, then throws it aggressively)</em> What?! No way!</div>

  <p><em>The Computer misses this time; on the screen, the catcher's mitt makes a low-effort swipe at the ball as it sails overhead.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
  <div>You love frisbee.</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div><em>(Annoyed)</em> Frisbee is a brand. It's called a <i>flying disc</i>, dummy.</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">COMPUTER</div>
  <div>I think he's lonely. You should be nicer to him.</div>

  <br />

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">SARA</div>
  <div><em>(rolling eyes)</em> Ugh, fine! <em>(Yells across the street)</em> Stinkums! Wanna play?</div>

  <p><em>Shot of Guy's face lighting up. When he turns around, his features are composed again.</em></p>

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">GUY</div>
  <div>Sure, whatever.</div>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><em>TO BE CONTINUED</em></p>
